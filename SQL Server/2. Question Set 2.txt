Primary Key vs Unique Key
2N's
N-Null
N-Number
-Both don't allow duplicates.
-Primary Key do not allow null values while Unique Key accept null value.
-In a table only one Primary Key is allowed , while many unique keys can be put.

char vs varchar
-char is fixed length, varchar is variable is length.
-char will occupy the same space in all entries, while varchar can be variable for each entry.

char vs nchar
-to store pure enlish character use char, n in nchar stands for unicode(non english character)
-for 1 character char takes 1 byte, nchar takes 2 bytes.

Use of Index in SQL Server
-Index helps to improve search performances.
-It creates a Balanced Tree structure thus search becomes faster, internally it creates Node and Leaf nodes to reach 
the data quickly.

Clustured Index vs Non-Clustured Index
-Both have balanced tree.
-In Clustured Index Leaf nodes points towards actual data/record, while non-clustured index Lead nodes points 
towards Clustured Index.
-This is why we can have only 1 Clustured Index and many non-Clustured Index.

Function vs Stored Procedure
-Function returns Computed Scalar values.
-You cannot make permanent changes(insert,update,delete) inside function.
-Stored Procedure is a mini program which can do anything.
-It can make changes, backup database.
-Funtion is for computation.
-Only select is allowed for computation using Function.
-Function can be called from Select/Where and from other stored procedure.
-Mostly scalar value is output, sometimes Table valued funtion are also output of Function
-Stored Procedure can change the environment.
-Insert,Updates and Delete is allowed in Stored Procedure.
-Stored Procedure cannot be executed from Select/Where or from other funtions.
-Can have Single or Multiple Output.

Triggers
-Triggers are small piece of logic which you want to execute when certain events like insert,delete,update happens, once any of these event happens you want to execute that logic.
-There are 2 types of Triggers
1. After Trigger - It is fired after the event has happened.
2. Instead Of Trigger - Intead of DML events logic gets executed.

Identity in SQL Server
-Identity helps to define auto increment column.
