3P's
1. To the Point
2. Be Prepared
3. Be Practical with Examples
Normalization
-It is a database design technique to remove/avoid redundant data.
-Normalization is implemented by Splitting tables into two, one with reference data and other with transaction data.

Denormalization
-It is a database design technique to improve search performance.
-Due to splitting of table in normalization, data needed to be fetched from different tables, thus SQL queries becomes slow.
-In denormalization, we merge different tables as our goal is to improve search performance.
-Duplicate data is present in denormalization.

OLTP vs OLAP
OLTP-Online Transaction Processing.
OLAP-Online Analytical Processing.
-High load databases have high amount of queries.
-In high performance database, to handle different types of queries effectively single database is divided into two databases 
OLTP & OLAP.
-Insert,Update,Delete in done in OLTP, while Read,Analyse is done in OLAP.
-After any Insert,Update,Delete operations in OLTP, ETL(Extraction Transformation Loading) process happens which updates OLAP to
OLTP.
-In OLTP normalization is follwed, thus redundancy is reduced, we follow normalization design(1st,2nd,3rd normal forms).
-In OLAP denormalization is followed to improve search performance and we follow denormalization design.

1st, 2nd, 3rd Normal Form
-A table is in 1NF when columns have atomic values. It should not have repeating groups.
-If table is not following 1NF, it can contain Insert,Update,Delete anamolies.
-A table is in 2NF if all the rules of 1NF is followed. All non-key columns should be fully dependent on the Primary Key.
-A table is in 3NF if all the rules of 1NF and 2NF is followed. No transient dependency should be present.
Transient dependency-Any non-key column depending directly on another non-key column.
APT
A-Atomici for 1NF
P-No partial dependency for 2NF
T-No transient dependency for 3NF
